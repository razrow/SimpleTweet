# Project 4 - *Twitter Part 2*

**Twitter Client** is an android app that lets users view a list of tweets, even while offline, and compose tweets.

Submitted by: **Rowan Briggs**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can compose a new tweet 

The following **optional** functionality is completed:

* [x] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular Parceler library.

* [ ] Links in tweets are clickable and will launch the web browser

* [x] User can open the twitter app offline and see last loaded tweets

* [ ] When a user leaves the compose view without publishing and there is existing text, prompt to save or delete the draft. If saved, the draft should then be persisted to disk and can later be resumed from the compose view.

* [ ] Enable your app to receive implicit intents from other apps. When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet.

## Notes

I was really excited to work with databases this week. I had one really bad hangup, and worked for over an hour in a call with a TA. All in all though, I got it to work and I'm honestly really proud of the app I made. I kind of want to go back and work on this one and Flixster to make them look cooler. I really wanted to add clickable links but just did not have enough time. All in all I am happy with my work though.

## Notes

This week was going better than last week. Some issues were getting started and Android studio being weird. I finally feel that I know where to go for help though. Another weird issue is I am not a big fan of Twitter APIs timeout things. It gets annoying waiting for 15 minutes to see if your app will work.
